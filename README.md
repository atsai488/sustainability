Hackathon Creation

This is a website that is made to tackle the problem of litter left over from USC tailgates.
The idea is to have USC tailgate permit prices to be proportionate to the amount of trash left over.
If the fans are able to reduce the amount of trash left behind, tailgate permit prices can be lowered, and the money saved from not needing to hire third party services to clean up can be used to give the fans merchandice and boost school pride.

Further improvements:
Take photos of McCarthy Quad that will show pockets of trash left behind and use computer vision to identitfy these areas, since USC keeps a record of permit holders and their area, trash scores can be attatched to permit holders. This will be similar to a credit score. The higher the trash score, the higher the permit price will be. 
Using the data about trash pockets, trash bins can be strategically placed to where the model will predict where the most amount of trash will be. This will help reduce the amount of trash left over, and minimize pollution caught in wind.
