                At USC, our football culture is widespread and celebrated. 
                With this comes the fanatic energy of football fans
                all across the nation. Before gamedays, fans flock to USC and
                gather across Mccarthy Quad to hold tailgates. This has now
                become a staple of USC tradition. However, after fans flood the
                stadium, their waste does not follow them.

            </div>
            <p class = "statement">
                My solution to this problem is a two-sided. By tracking the total amount of trash left over
                from USC tailgate parties, USC can adjust prices of tailgate permits. If there is less trash 
                left behind, tailgate permits can be cheaper because USC will not be required to hire third-party 
                services to clean up. They could then use that money to offer free merchandise or events for the 
                crowd as a reward. The follow-up to this problem would involve attatching the trash to the owner. 
                It would act like a credit score of sort, with trash concentration being kept tracked of and put to whoever 
                had the permit to that area. This would then allow USC to put more trash cans/recyling cans strategically 
                to reduce pollution on the floor. They could then offer personal discounts to users who create less trash.
